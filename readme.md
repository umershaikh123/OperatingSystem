### Usage

To run the Round Robin algorithm, navigate to the `task1` folder and follow the instructions below
1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/umershaikh123/OperatingSystem.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd OperatingSystem/Task1`
3. Run the simulation: `node .\Final.js`

## Task 2: SRT, SJF, HRRN Algorithms with GUI and Visualization
This task implements the Shortest Remaining Time (SRT), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) scheduling algorithms. It includes a GUI and visualization for better understanding.
